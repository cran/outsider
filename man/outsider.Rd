\title{outsider: Install and run programs, outside of R, inside of R}
\description{
The outsider package facilitates the installation and running of external
software by interfacing with docker (\url{https://www.docker.com/}).
External software are contained within mini-R-packages, called "outsider
modules" and can be installed directly to a user's computer through online
code-sharing services such as GitHub (\url{https://github.com/}). The
outsider package comes with a series of functions for identifying,
installing and importing these outsider modules.
