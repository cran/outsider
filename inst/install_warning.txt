Warning: You are about to install an outsider module!
-----------------------------------------------------
Outsider modules install and run external programs
via Docker <https://www.docker.com>. These external
programs may communicate with the internet and could
potentially be malicious.

Be sure to know the module you are about to install:
Is it from a trusted developer? Are colleagues using
it? Is it supposed to download lots of data? Is it
well used (e.g. check number of stars on GitHub)?
